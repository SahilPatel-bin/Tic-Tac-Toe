# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple paper-and-pencil game for two players. It's a classic game often used to introduce children to strategic thinking.

Gameplay:

1) Board: The game is played on a grid of 3 squares by 3 squares, forming a total of 9 squares.
2) Players: Two players take turns marking the empty spaces on the grid, one using the symbol "X" and the other using "O".
3) Goal: The first player to successfully place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
4) Turns: Players take turns marking an empty square on the grid. There's no universally agreed-upon rule for who goes first.
5) Tie: If all nine squares are filled before either player achieves a winning row, the game ends in a tie.
